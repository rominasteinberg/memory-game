## Instructions

To start playing, you must click on any card that is flipped over.
Then try a second one.
If the cards turn red, you should keep trying.
If they match, they will be fixed and change color.
By matching the 8 pairs, you will have a summary of how your game has gone.

## Note for the Reviewer

When I started writing my code, I did it in Spanish, since it was easier for me to understand it and carry it out.
My idea was to make the translation once it was finished and working.
Big mistake.
When I wanted to translate it, it started to break everywhere, so I decided to leave it like this and learn for the next projects.
I will try to leave comments throughout the code to make it easy to read. Sorry for the inconvenience.
